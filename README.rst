purepycrypt
===========

This is a fork of the PyCA/cryptography project at the last point at which it was pure-python (current versions require Rust, making it unavailable on platforms where Rust is not available)

This fork does not intend to track the origin going forward.  Our intention is to provide standards-compliant X.509 support for parsing and verification (which pyca/cryptography explicitly refuses to do).

Please file tickets where the current code base deviates from ITU-X standards that you require.
